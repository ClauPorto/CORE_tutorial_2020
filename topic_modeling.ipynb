        "- You can change the number of topics learned by the model to include more or less detail that may reveal different \"levels\" of granularity. You may want to try using \"coherence\" as a metric to determine the number of topics that maximizes the similarity among words within the same topic. What broad or fine-grained differences can you find that differentiate real and fake news? \n",
        "- One way of reducing \"overlap\" among words within topics is to **stem** each word and convert it to a base form that is shared among different versions of the word (e.g. `dog` and `dogs` stemmed to `dog`). What happens if you stem the text before training the topic model?"
